# y_footy_analytics_tho

The purpose of y_footy_analytics_tho is to have a data visualisations that can show me trends and outliers based on football leagues to make
better decisions for my FPL, which will help others who want to attain a competive edge to their teams transfers and selections.

The intention is to build various iterations of this web-based platform. For version 1.0 I itend to use the following technolgies to build the platform:
- Python (Programming langauge)
- Python Google Sheets API (Data storage and warehousing)
- Streamlit (Web-based dashboards for data visusaliations)
- Pandas (Data cleaning, mining and aggregation)
- Matplotlib + Seaborn (Data visualisations)

These are the main technolgies that will be used. Any other modules used can be found within the "requirements.txt" of the repository.

Please provide any feedback and platform and any suggestions for the platform that I can implement into version 2.0. 

I hope you enjoy the app :)
